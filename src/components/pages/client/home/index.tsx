          I{"'"}m so glad to share with you guys some photos from my recent trip
          to New York. This city looks amazing, the buildings, nature, and
          people are all beautiful. I highly recommend visiting this cool place!
          Also, I would love to know what is your favorite place here or what
          you would like to visit? ðŸ—½
